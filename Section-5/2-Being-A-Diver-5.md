# Being a Diver V

## Gas Narcosis

1. What are the signs and symptoms of gas narcosis?
   - Feeling intoxicated (drunk or “high”)
   - Loss of coordination
   - Slowed thinking
   - Slowed reactions
   - Inappropriate laughter
   - Depression
   - False sense of security
   - Ignoring or disregard for safety
   - Anxiety and/or panic (when under stress at depth)
2. What potential hazard does gas narcosis present?
   - Gas narcosis is not thought to be harmful itself. The hazard is that it impairs the good judgment, clear thinking and timely responses you need to avoid and manage problems underwater.
3. Generally, what causes gas narcosis?
   - Thought to be caused by increased dissolved gases in body tissues slowing nerve impulses that travel in the brain and nervous system
4. At what depth do most divers usually begin to notice gas narcosis?
   - approximately 30 metres/100 feet
5. What factors may influence susceptibility to gas narcosis?
   - Being tired, dehydrated or generally fatigued may make narcosis noticeable shallower, and some prescription and over-the-counter drugs combine their effects with narcosis, making intoxication stronger (this is another reason why you don’t use alcohol and certain drugs before diving).
6. How do I avoid gas narcosis? What do I do if it occurs?
   - don't dive too deep.
   - if it occurs then ascend to a shallower depth

## Finding Your Way

1. What are five benefits of navigating underwater?
   - It helps you plan your dive so you don’t waste air trying to find the best parts of the dive site.
   - It allows you to avoid long surface swims by navigating to your ascent/exit point underwater.
   - It helps you take the shortest route to the boat or shore if you have a problem.
   - It lets you avoid certain areas if necessary, or stay within a certain area.
   - It reduces stress, because you know generally where you are at any point of the dive, and you can be less concerned about how far you are from your exit/ascent point, etc.
2. What four basic features does an underwater compass have? What is the purpose of each?
   - Magnetic north needle: helps determine direction
   - Lubber line: shows your line of travel
   - Bezel with index marks: he bezel rotates so you can align two, small parallel marks (index marks) over the north needle. This helps you maintain a straight line while swimming and navigating. Some compasses have two sets of index marks. The second set is 180º opposite the first. This lets you set a return (reciprocal) course without having to reset the compass.
   - Heading references: numbers to record your heading
3. How should I hold a compass when navigating with it underwater?
   - Hold your compass so it’s relatively level (so the north needle can rotate) and so the lubber line is aligned with the centerline of your body. Wearing the compass on your wrist, hold the arm without the compass straight out. Hold it with your other hand near the elbow, putting the compass straight in front of you. With a console, hold the compass squarely in front of you with both hands.
4. How should I set a compass to navigate a straight line from one point to another? How should I set it to return along the same line (the reciprocal heading)?
   - 
5. How should I use an electronic compass to navigate?
   - 

## Continuing Your Adventure

1. What is a Course Evaluation Questionnaire?
   - Survey that allows PADI Offices to recognize outstanding performance by instructors, and to verify that your course included certain key training elements. It helps PADI maintain the quality of its diver education programs.
2. What are my limits as a PADI Open Water Diver?
   - maximum depth of 18 metres/60 feet
   - but with additional experience and training that can become 40 metres/130 feet
3. How do I stay involved with diving? What are my options for continuing to learn as a diver?
   - ou can enroll and participate in the PADI Advanced Open Water Diver course, Discover Local Diving program and many (but not all) PADI Specialty Diver courses to increase your skills and experience.
4. What is the purpose of the PADI System of diver education?
   - idk, think about it
