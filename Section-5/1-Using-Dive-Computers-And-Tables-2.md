# Using Dive Computers and Tables II

## Planning a Minimum Surface Interval

1. Why would I need to find a minimum surface interval?
   - to make repetitive dives
2. What are three ways I can find a minimum surface interval with a dive computer without using dive tables?
   - Wait and check
   - Use the dive computer plan mode
   - Use a tablet/smartphone app
3. How can finding minimum surface intervals with the RDP Table and eRDPML help me plan them with dive computers?
   - gives you a good estimate

## Flying After Diving and Altitude Diving

1. Why is going to altitude after diving a potential issue?
   - increases risk of decompression sickness
2. How do flying after diving and altitude diving differ?
   - When flying after diving (or ascending to altitude after diving), you start and end your dive at sea level (normal surface pressure), and then go to altitude (lower surface pressure). When altitude diving, you start and end your dive at altitude (lower surface pressure).
3. What are the current recommendations for flying after diving?
   - Single dives (no repetitive dive) – A minimum preflight surface interval of 12 hours is suggested.
   - Repetitive dives or multi-day dives (diving every day for several days in a row) – A minimum preflight surface interval of 18 hours is suggested.
4. How do I keep up with the recommendations for flying after diving?
   - diver publications and websites including https://diversalertnetwork.org
5. Above what altitude do I need to use altitude diving procedures?
   - 300 metres/1000 feet or higher

## Cold and/or Strenuous Dives

1. Why are being cold and/or exerting myself strenuously issues with respect to decompression sickness risk?
   - you may end the dive with more dissolved nitrogen than calculated by your dive computer
2. What should I do if I am cold or exert myself strenuously on a dive?
   - be more conservative
   - With the RDP Table and the eRDPML, you plan cold/strenuous dives as though they are 4 metres/10 feet deeper than their actual depth

## Emergency Decompression Stops

1. When do I need to make an emergency decompression stop?
   - when you fail to monitor and respect the dive computer or something forced you to overstay
2. How do I determine the depth(s) and time(s) of emergency decompression stop(s)?
   - your computer will go into decompression mode
3. What should I do if I surface from a dive without making a required emergency decompression stop?
   - relax, breathe 100 percent emergency oxygen if available and monitor yourself for decompression sickness symptoms. Don’t dive again for at least 24 hours.

## First Aid and Treatment for Decompression Illness

1. What is meant by decompression illness?
   - Lung overexpansion injuries or decompression sickness
2. What is the first aid for a diver with suspected decompression illness? What treatment is usually required?
   - cpr if necessary
   - keep diver lying down
   - emergency oxygen
