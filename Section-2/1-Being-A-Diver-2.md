# Being a Diver II

## Seeing and Hearing as a Diver

1. How does being underwater affect the apparent size or distance of things?
   - things appear closer and bigger
2. How does water affect light intensity and color?
   - Colors get deeper and more muted the deeper you go, but it depends on wavelength. You can see the following colors up to the following depths:
     - red: 4.5m
     - orange: 15m
     - yellow: 30m
     - green: 76m
     - purple: roughly 85m?
3. How does hearing differ underwater?
   - It's easier to hear underwater due to water density. It's hard to tell how are away boats are and their location.

## Swimming and Moving

1. How does water’s density affect moving in water?
   - higher density makes it harder to move. water has more inertia than air due to density. It takes four times as much energy to double your speed.
2. How do I move efficiently as a diver?
   - Don't rush. Move slow and steady.
3. How does streamlining benefit me as a diver?
   - Reduces drag.
4. Why is trim important to streamlining, moving efficiently and protecting the underwater environment?
   - Poor trim raises or lowers my feet, causing drag.
5. What skill allows me to use water’s density to make moving in water more efficient?
   - shut up

## Staying Warm

1. Why do I chill faster in water than in air at the same temperature?
   - Water can absorb more heat than air. It takes more energy to raise the temperature of water than air.
2. What do I do to stay comfortably warm while diving?
   - Choose an appropriate exposure suit – a wet suit or dry suit – to insulate you. Generally, you need one when diving in water 24ºC/75ºF or cooler, but even in warmer water most divers still use an exposure suit.
3. What should I do if I’m not warm enough while diving?
   - End the dive and use more exposure protection next time.
4. What should I do if I start shivering uncontrollably?
   - Exit the water immediately, dry off and seek warmth.

## Breathing Effectively Underwater

1. What is the most effective way to breathe while diving? Why is it important?
   - slowly and deeply because it takes more energy to breathe underwater and you don't want to breathe too much dead air because the dead air from your last breath contains more CO2
2. What is “airway control”? What are two techniques for it?
   - airway control is breathing past the little bit of water in your regulator or snorkel without breathing it in. First technique in airway control is to inhale slowly. Second is to touch your tongue to the roof of your mouth. Looking downward helps, too. Cough if you have to but hold your regulator when you do.
3. What are eight symptoms of overexertion while diving?
   - Fatigue
   - Labored breathing
   - A feeling of suffocation or air starvation
   - Weakness
   - Anxiety
   - Headache
   - Muscle cramping
   - A tendency to panic
4. What causes overexertion while diving? How do I prevent it?
   - Results from prolonged elevated effort, like fighting a current. It is caused by trying to breathe dense air rapidly, faster than equipment can deliver it. 
5. What should I do if I think I’m becoming overexerted at the surface and underwater?
   - Breathing slowly, deeply and continuously. Avoid lengthy, strenuous exertion while diving. If your breathing rate begins to rise, stop and rest before it becomes labored.

## The Buddy System (continued)

1. How do my buddy(ies) and I plan dives together? What nine points should a dive plan normally include?
   - Agree on the best entry and exit techniques for the environment.
   - Decide what course you’ll follow.
   - Agree on the maximum time and depth.
   - Review underwater signals and other communications.
   - Determine when you will turn the dive and head back based on your remaining air, time and/or other factors – whichever comes first.
   - Agree on how you’ll stay together during the dive (e.g., swim side by side, one leads while the others follow, etc.).
   - Establish what you will do if you become separated.
   - Discuss emergency procedures.
   - Agree on an objective. An objective may be detailed, such as “shoot videos of butterfly fish pairs,” or as simple as, “let’s go for a look.”
2. How do my buddy(ies) and I kit up together?
   - You and your buddy(ies) gear up at the same time so you’re ready to get in the water together.
3. How and when do we conduct the pre-dive safety check?
   - Once y'all are suited up you begin the pre-dive safety check.
   - Begin With Review And Friend
     - Begin – B – BCD
     - With – W – Weight
     - With – W – Weight:
     - And – A – Air
     - Friend – F – Final Check
4. What do I do if I get separated from my buddy(ies) during a dive?
   - The general procedure is to look for each other for no more than a minute, then if unable to relocate each other, carefully ascend and reunite on the surface.
5. Whose responsibility is the buddy system?
   - It’s your responsibility to stay with your buddy

## Managing Your Air Supply as a Buddy Team

1. How do my buddy(ies) and I manage our air supply together while diving?
   - Make a plan? Do some math.

## Swimming at the Surface

1. Why is it a good habit to keep my mask on and a snorkel or regulator in my mouth while at the surface in water too deep in which to stand?
   - Under stress, you tend to do what you do by habit. When in difficulty, you may need to see and breathe effectively with your face in the water. If your mask is off and/or you have no mouthpiece in, you respond more slowly if you must put them back on to deal with a problem.
   - Also protects your vision and airway.
2. What are three reasons why I may swim on the surface while scuba diving?
   - To save air when you must enter the water some distance from where you want to descend and/or ascend.
   - To save air while looking for where you want to descend.
   - Because you may surface away from your exit point and must swim to it on the surface.
3. What are two methods for surface swimming while scuba diving?
   - Face down and ass up, breathing through snorkel.
   - For longer swims, you can swim on your back with your head out of the water.
4. How do I maintain the buddy system while swimming at the surface?
   - Buddy rules still apply at the surface.

## Descents in Open Water

1. What are the five steps for a proper descent with scuba?
   - Confirm that your buddies are ready.
   - Orient yourselves to something at the surface or underwater, such as the boat or a landmark.
   - Switch from your snorkel to your regulator.
   - Check, and if necessary activate, your dive computer or timer.
   - Signal “descend” and, with your buddies, slowly deflate your BCD.
2. How do I descend with and without a reference?
   - Descend slowly from the beginning. Keep your head above your feet to make equalizing easier and help you stay oriented, and stay close to your buddy.
   - With reference:
     - Primarily use your BCD to descend but you may use the reference line if the current is bad
   - Without reference:
     - stay with buddy and read your computer
3. When do I start equalizing when I descend? How often do I equalize?
   - Begin immediately when entering water, then every meter.
4. What happens to my buoyancy as I descend and why?
   - as you descend your buoyancy decreases because your suit compresses and becomes more dense
5. How do I control my buoyancy as I descend?
   - use your BCD.

## Ascents in Open Water

1. What are the five steps for a proper ascent with scuba?
   - Signal “up” and confirm that your buddies are ready
   - Check your dive computer to be sure you’re within its limits.
   - Look up and hold up your BCD deflator hose.
   - Ascend slowly – no faster than your dive computer’s maximum rate.
   - Look up and turn as you ascend, and stay with your buddies.
2. How do I start my ascent?
   - signal "up" and confirm with buddy.
3. What is the proper rate to ascend while scuba diving?
   - Maximum ascent rate is 18 metres/60 feet per minute, but most dive computers require a slower rate of 10 metres/30 feet per minute.
4. What happens to my buoyancy as I ascend? Why?
   - buoyancy increases.
5. How do I control my buoyancy while ascending?
   - release air from bcd or dry suit at you ascend.
   - stay with buddy
6. How do I ascend with and without a reference in open water?
   - With reference:
     - use bcd to ascend but hold onto a reference if you have to
   - Without reference:
     - one buddy does direction while one checks depth on computer
     - stay with buddy
7. What is a safety stop? How do I make one? When would I not make one?
   - Pause in your ascent between 6 metres/20 feet and 3 metres/10 feet (commonly 5 metres/15 feet) for three to five minutes.
   - To make the stop, you and your buddy(ies) slow your ascent as you pass 6 metres/20 feet and fine-tune for neutral buoyancy. Pause at about 5 metres/15 feet for three minutes or longer – variations of a metre/three feet above or below are not a problem. During the stop, check your computer to be sure you didn’t accidentally overstay its limits.
8. What do I do during the final stages of my ascent?
   - As you ascend the final distance, look up and reach up with your BCD deflator in your left hand. You will need to vent expanding air from your BCD to control your buoyancy. Rotate if necessary to check for obstructions overhead.
   - Keep your hand up as you break the surface. Continue to breathe from your regulator as you inflate your BCD. After making sure you’re floating comfortably, switch to your snorkel.
