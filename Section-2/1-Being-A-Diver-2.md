# Being a Diver II

## Seeing and Hearing as a Diver

1. How does being underwater affect the apparent size or distance of things?
   - things appear closer and bigger
2. How does water affect light intensity and color?
   - Colors get deeper and more muted the deeper you go, but it depends on wavelength. You can see the following colors up to the following depths:
     - red: 4.5m
     - orange: 15m
     - yellow: 30m
     - green: 76m
     - purple: roughly 85m?
3. How does hearing differ underwater?
   - It's easier to hear underwater due to water density. It's hard to tell how are away boats are and their location.
