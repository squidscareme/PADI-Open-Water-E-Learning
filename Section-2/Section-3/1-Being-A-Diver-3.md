# Being a Diver III

## Dive Environments and Conditions

1. What types of environments might I dive in?
   - coral reefs
   - temperate water oceans
   - lakes and reservoirs
   - rivers
   - springs
   - flooded quarries
   - human-made dive environments
2. What six general environmental conditions can affect me while diving?
   - temperature
   - visibility
   - water movement
   - bottom composition
   - aquatic life
   - sunlight
3. How can I expect depth to affect water temperature?
   - At a certain point you reach the thermocline, which is the barrier between the warm upper waters and the cooler deep waters.
4. How do I measure (define) visibility as a diver?
   - Measure visibility as the distance you can see horizontally underwater
5. What four principal factors affect visibility?
   - Water movement (kicks up sand om the bottom)
   - weather (wind creates waves)
   - plankton
   - The nature and composition of particles in the water
6. In what three ways can reduced visibility affect me while diving? What do I do about them?
   - more difficult to stay with buddies
   - harder to track where you are and where you're going
   - ascending/descending is disorienting
7. How do I avoid the potential problems of diving in clear water?
   - stay close to your buddy. the bottom and your buddy may appear close but they might not be. Always stay within 2 seconds to your buddy.
8. What two types of water movement primarily affect me as a diver?
    - waves
    - current
9. When diving in a mild current, in what direction would I normally go? Why?
    - currents are strongest closest to the surface and tend to decrease as you get deeper.
    - dive into the current and descend as fast as safe.
10. What do I do if I’m caught in a current and am carried downstream from where I planned to dive or exit the water?
    - swim perpendicular to the current
11. What should I do if I get caught in a surface current while diving from a boat and find myself unable to swim to the boat?
    - remain calm and inflate your BCD (drop weights if you need to)
    - signal the boat
12. What are five types of bottom compositions I’m likely to find while diving?
    - Silt/mud
    - Sand
    - Rock
    - Coral
    - Vegetation
13. How do I avoid contact with the bottom? What are three reasons why it is beneficial to avoid bottom contact?
    - avoid contact with the bottom by staying neutrally buoyant and swim well above it
    - three reason to avoid bottom contact:
      - contact tends to reduce visibility
      - contact with some bottoms may present hazards. In environments like coral and rock, you can get cuts or scrapes if you’re not careful. Animals will mess you up with stings and shit. Vegetation has entanglement risks.
      - many aquatic organisms that live on the bottom are fragile and sensitive
14. How does sunlight affect me as a diver? How can I avoid sunburn?
    - it can overheat you and cause sunburn
    - avoid it by staying in shade as much as possible
15. What differences can I expect between diving in fresh water and in salt water?
    - Fresh water is less dense and therefore less buoyant than salt.
    - Marine environments tend to have more types and amounts of aquatic life
    - Very distinct thermoclines (temperature changes) within the recreational diving depth range are more common in fresh water
    - Freshwater environments are more likely to have bottoms that you can stir up easily
    - Marine environments generally have more differences in water motion – currents and waves. For practical purposes, freshwater bodies don’t have tides, whereas tides can significantly affect marine bodies.

## Diving Within Your Limits

1. What is meant by “diving within my limits”? Why is it important to do so?
   - you do not exceed the limits of your training and/or experience as well as comfort
   - failure to dive within your limits contributes to incidents and accidents
2. How does failure to dive within my limits raise my risk while diving?
   - three ways:
     - some forms of diving have risks that may not be obvious.
     - exceeding limits can cause false security
     - it raises your risk is indirectly
3. How do I expand my limits?
   - training and dive with more experienced divers
4. What should I do if someone subjects me to peer pressure to make a dive that is beyond my limits or that makes me uncomfortable?
   - usually all you have to do is politely say “no”

## Aquatic Life

1. What are the two basic types of interactions I can have with aquatic life? Which interaction should I generally have?
   - two types:
     - passive
     - active
   - you generally want to have passive interactions
2. What are the different types of potentially hazardous aquatic organisms?
   - sting/puncture:
     - Jellyfish
     - Stingrays
     - Sea urchins
     - Portuguese man-o-war
     - Lionfish and scorpion fish
     - Cone shells
     - Fire coral and other hydroids
     - Sea nettles
   - bite:
     - Moray eels
     - Barracuda and other fish
     - Clawed lobsters/crab (pinchers, not a true bite)
     - Trigger fish
     - Crocodilians
     - Some sharks (not all)
     - Snakes (venomous bite)
     - Octopuses (a few species have a venomous bite)
3. What causes nearly all injuries from aquatic life?
   - human carelessness
4. What nine steps should I follow to prevent and/or handle aquatic injuries caused by aquatic animals?
   - Be familiar with potentially hazardous organisms that may be in the local environment
   - Treat all organisms with respect.
   - Avoid wearing shiny, dangling jewelry
   - Watch where you put your feet, knees and hands
   - Maintain neutral buoyancy
   - Be cautious in murky water
   - You should generally avoid contact with all organisms, but especially avoid contact with unfamiliar ones
   - Be cautious with apparently dead organisms or detached body parts. Jellyfish, in particular, still sting when dead as do their detached tentacles.
   - In case of an aquatic life injury, be prepared and apply basic first aid.
5. What should I do if I see a potentially aggressive animal underwater?
   - You should watch it and enjoy the experience
   - Remain still and calm on or near the bottom, and don’t swim toward the creature
   - If it stays in the area longer than you’re comfortable, calmly swim away along the bottom, keeping an eye on it, and exit the water if it seems overly curious or aggressive.
6. Why are there laws and regulations concerning aquatic life? Why is it important that I follow them?
   - to preserve and protect organisms, and also for human safety
   - It is important to follow these laws and regulations to avoid legal consequences, to set a good example, and to help preserve the aquatic world.
7. What hazards may aquatic plants present?
   - they provide a home for potentially dangerous animals
   - you can get tangled
8. What is Project AWARE? How can I participate in Project AWARE’s mission?
   - Project AWARE is a movement of scuba divers protecting our ocean planet – one dive at a time
   - You can participate directly as a volunteer, by making a donation or both

## Diving from Shore

1. What are the procedures for entering and exiting the water when diving from shore? What are some of the considerations?
   - procedures:
     - Begin by evaluating the environment and conditions, and planning the dive with your buddy(ies)
     - Gear up, pacing yourselves so you’re ready at the same time and remembering to put exposure suits on at the last moment in hot climates, especially if you have to walk some distance to the water.
     - Typically, you put on all your equipment except your mask, fins, snorkel and gloves, then conduct your predive safety check.
     - Put on your mask, snorkel and gloves just before you enter. When shore diving you may put your fins on in waist-to-chest deep water, depending upon the entry technique you use.
   - considerations:
     - bottom composition and hazardous or fragile aquatic life if you will be wading.
     - wave, surge and current.
     - the best entry and exit techniques for the situations
     - surface swim distance (surface swims when shore diving are commonly longer than when boat diving).
2. How does the environment affect the best way to wade as I walk through water shallow enough in which to stand?
   - idk, just figure it out
3. What are typical methods I should use to descend and ascend when shore diving?
   - Wading to and from water too deep in which to stand are probably the most common entry and exit techniques

## Shore Diving Through Mild Surf

1. In what depth water do waves break? Why should I avoid diving in anything larger than mild surf without special training?
   - Waves break in water only slightly deeper than their height
   - Avoid large surf because not only can it be hazardous, but the dive conditions tend to be poor anyway.
2. What causes surge and undertow? How do they affect me as a diver and how should I adjust for them?
   - Waves coming into shore create surge and undertow. Can be disorienting.
   - Surge is a back-and-forth motion caused by waves passing overhead
   - Undertow is the water of breaking waves flowing back to sea under incoming waves. Can cause you to lose your balance
3. What causes currents to move parallel to shore, and how may they affect my dive plan?
   - Waves approaching the shoreline at an angle.
   - You might need to enter at one place and exit another
   - Might swim into the current and then let it carry you back to the exit place
4. What is a rip current and what causes it? What should I do if I get caught in one?
   - Rip currents result when waves push water over a long obstruction (such as a reef or sandbar)
   - establish buoyancy and swim at a sustainable pace parallel to shore until clear of the rip
5. What can cause deeper water to rise toward the surface? How may it affect dive conditions?
   - Wind blowing from shore can push surface water away, causing cooler, deeper water to rise toward the surface to replace it.
   - In many environments, upwellings are associated with excellent diving conditions because deeper water, while cooler, tends to be clearer. They may also bring up nutrients that support marine life.
6. What three environmental conditions do tides generally affect? When is generally the best time to shore dive with respect to the tide?
   - Currents
   - Depth
   - Visibility
7. How should I enter and exit the water through mild surf?
   - Start by watching the waves
   - When ready and during a lull, enter with all your equipment in place, except your fins. Have enough air in your BCD so you would float. Use your regulator so you can breathe in case a wave causes you to stumble.
   - Staying with your buddy(ies), wade quickly toward deeper water
   - When you reach water deep enough in which to swim (waist to chest deep for most people), put on your fins and continue to swim out. The idea is to swim through the surf zone as quickly as possible.
   - Once clear of the surf zone, switch to your snorkel to conserve air if you will continue to swim on the surface. You and your buddy(ies) may descend immediately once past the surf zone, or you may continue on the surface to a specific place where you want to descend.
   - You use your regulator during your exit, so save enough air for this, in addition to your reserve.
   - When exiting, surface outside the surf zone.

## Diving from Boats – Preparation

1. How should I pack and prepare my gear for a boat dive?
   - Start by inspecting your gear and making sure it’s working.
   - Use a proper gear bag. Pack what you need first on top.
2. How should I prepare myself for a boat dive?
   - Make sure you’re well rested and fed to make the most of the trip
   - Avoid alcohol and drink plenty of water
3. How can I prevent seasickness? What should I do if I begin to feel seasick?
   - take seasickness medication
   - avoid greasy or hard to digest foods
   - If you do feel motion sick, stay in open, fresh air and look at the horizon or close your eyes

## Diving from Boats - Procedures

### This section has questions are mostly common sense but also hard to get clear answers to specific questions. I could not copy-paste answers to most of the questions.

1. Why is a roll call important for my safety?
   - because it greatly reduces the risk of accidentally leaving someone behind at the site
2. How should I gear up and move around on a dive boat? Why is it important to secure my equipment on a boat?
   - If it is only minutes, you may get into all your gear before the boat leaves the dock. More typically, though, you set up your kit, but wait until the boat nears or arrives at the dive site to put on your exposure suit and gear up.
3. What are the general procedures and considerations for entering the water when diving from a boat?
   - 
4. What are typical methods I may use to descend and ascend when boat diving? Why is it important to stay well away from a dive boat’s propeller?
   - 
5. Why should I avoid swimming just below the surface?
   - 
6. What are the general procedures and considerations for exiting the water when diving from a boat?
   - 
7. What are the general procedures for diving from a boat in a moderate current? How should I use a trail (tag) line, swim line and mooring/anchor line when diving from a boat in a moderate current?
   - 
8. What should I do if I surface from a boat dive and the boat is not in sight?
   - 

## Dive Planning

1. What are the four stages of dive planning?
   - advance planning
   - preparation planning
   - last-minute preparation
   - predive planning
2. What should I do during the advance planning stage?
   - Deciding on which buddy(ies) and/or dive operator
   - Choosing a dive site
   - Agreeing on an objective
   - Scheduling logistics (where and when you will meet, get in the water, etc)
   - Checking dive conditions
3. What should I do during the preparation planning stage?
   - Typically, you inspect your gear to be sure it’s all working properly and together
4. What five steps should I follow during the last-minute preparation planning stage?
   - Last-minute preparation is what you do a few hours before, right up to when you leave for the dive site. Typically, you’ll include these five steps:
     - Recheck the weather
     - Let someone know where you’re going
     - Gather personal items you’ll want
     - Pack any remaining items into your gear bag
     - Double check that you’re not forgetting anything
5. What seven steps should I follow during the predive planning stage?
   - Evaluate the conditions
   - Decide whether the conditions are acceptable for diving
   - Agree on techniques, including where/how to enter, the course to follow, techniques you’ll use during the dive and where/how to exit
   - Review signals and communications as necessary.
   - Agree on buddy separation procedures
   - Agree on time, depth and air supply limits
   - Discuss what to do if an emergency arises
6. What considerations should I have when I plan extended dive travel?
   - what gear to take
   - anything you need to rent
   - take your log book and certification
