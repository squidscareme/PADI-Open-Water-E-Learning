# Being a Diver III

## Dive Environments and Conditions

1. What types of environments might I dive in?
   - coral reefs
   - temperate water oceans
   - lakes and reservoirs
   - rivers
   - springs
   - flooded quarries
   - human-made dive environments
2. What six general environmental conditions can affect me while diving?
   - temperature
   - visibility
   - water movement
   - bottom composition
   - aquatic life
   - sunlight
3. How can I expect depth to affect water temperature?
   - At a certain point you reach the thermocline, which is the barrier between the warm upper waters and the cooler deep waters.
4. How do I measure (define) visibility as a diver?
   - Measure visibility as the distance you can see horizontally underwater
5. What four principal factors affect visibility?
   - Water movement (kicks up sand om the bottom)
   - weather (wind creates waves)
   - plankton
   - The nature and composition of particles in the water
6. In what three ways can reduced visibility affect me while diving? What do I do about them?
   - more difficult to stay with buddies
   - harder to track where you are and where you're going
   - ascending/descending is disorienting
7. How do I avoid the potential problems of diving in clear water?
   - stay close to your buddy. the bottom and your buddy may appear close but they might not be. Always stay within 2 seconds to your buddy.
8. What two types of water movement primarily affect me as a diver?
    - waves
    - current
9. When diving in a mild current, in what direction would I normally go? Why?
    - currents are strongest closest to the surface and tend to decrease as you get deeper.
    - dive into the current and descend as fast as safe.
10. What do I do if I’m caught in a current and am carried downstream from where I planned to dive or exit the water?
    - swim perpendicular to the current
11. What should I do if I get caught in a surface current while diving from a boat and find myself unable to swim to the boat?
    - remain calm and inflate your BCD (drop weights if you need to)
    - signal the boat
12. What are five types of bottom compositions I’m likely to find while diving?
    - Silt/mud
    - Sand
    - Rock
    - Coral
    - Vegetation
13. How do I avoid contact with the bottom? What are three reasons why it is beneficial to avoid bottom contact?
    - avoid contact with the bottom by staying neutrally buoyant and swim well above it
    - three reason to avoid bottom contact:
      - contact tends to reduce visibility
      - contact with some bottoms may present hazards. In environments like coral and rock, you can get cuts or scrapes if you’re not careful. Animals will mess you up with stings and shit. Vegetation has entanglement risks.
      - many aquatic organisms that live on the bottom are fragile and sensitive
14. How does sunlight affect me as a diver? How can I avoid sunburn?
    - it can overheat you and cause sunburn
    - avoid it by staying in shade as much as possible
15. What differences can I expect between diving in fresh water and in salt water?
    - Fresh water is less dense and therefore less buoyant than salt.
    - Marine environments tend to have more types and amounts of aquatic life
    - Very distinct thermoclines (temperature changes) within the recreational diving depth range are more common in fresh water
    - Freshwater environments are more likely to have bottoms that you can stir up easily
    - Marine environments generally have more differences in water motion – currents and waves. For practical purposes, freshwater bodies don’t have tides, whereas tides can significantly affect marine bodies.
