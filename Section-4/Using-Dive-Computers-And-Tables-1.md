# Using Dive Computers And Tables I

## How Dive Computers and Tables Work

1. How does a dive computer or dive table estimate the amount of nitrogen I absorb during a dive?
   - By using your dive time and depth information to calculate the theoretical amount of nitrogen in your body. They compare these estimates against limits that resulted from experimental dives and human experience.
2. Does a dive computer or dive table directly assess anything going on inside a diverâ€™s body?
   - of course not, asshole. did you insert the dive computer's prove into your asshole?
3. Why can no dive computer or table guarantee that decompression sickness will never occur, even within its limits? How do I address this concern?
   - Because people vary in their susceptibility to decompression sickness

   - 
2. What is a no stop (no decompression) limit?
   - 
3. What do I have to do if I exceed a no stop limit?
   - 
4. What is the relationship between depth and my no stop limits?
   - 
5. What happens to my no stop limits as I ascend to a shallower depth during a dive?
   - 
6. Why is my ascent rate an important part of a no stop dive?
   - 
7. What is the difference between a decompression stop and a safety stop?
