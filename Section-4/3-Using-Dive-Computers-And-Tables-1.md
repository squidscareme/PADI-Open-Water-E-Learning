# Using Dive Computers And Tables I

## How Dive Computers and Tables Work

1. How does a dive computer or dive table estimate the amount of nitrogen I absorb during a dive?
   - By using your dive time and depth information to calculate the theoretical amount of nitrogen in your body. They compare these estimates against limits that resulted from experimental dives and human experience.
2. Does a dive computer or dive table directly assess anything going on inside a diver’s body?
   - of course not, asshole. did you insert the dive computer's prove into your asshole?
3. Why can no dive computer or table guarantee that decompression sickness will never occur, even within its limits? How do I address this concern?
   - Because people vary in their susceptibility to decompression sickness

## No Stop Diving

1. What is no stop (no decompression) diving?
   - Planning your dive so that you can, if necessary, swim directly to the surface without unacceptable risk of decompression sickness
2. What is a no stop (no decompression) limit?
   - A no stop limit is the maximum time you can spend at a given depth and still ascend directly to the surface.
3. What do I have to do if I exceed a no stop limit?
   - You must make one or more emergency decompression stops.
4. What is the relationship between depth and my no stop limits?
   - The deeper you go, the less time you have
5. What happens to my no stop limits as I ascend to a shallower depth during a dive?
   - Nitrogen absorption slows, so the remaining no stop time will increase for that shallower depth.
6. Why is my ascent rate an important part of a no stop dive?
   - The no stop time assumes that you ascend at that rate. If you go faster than that rate, you may increase your risk of DCS.
7. What is the difference between a decompression stop and a safety stop?
   - A safety stop is not required to be within the limits of most dive computers’ or tables’ decompression models, though you should just to be conservative and extra safe. A decompression stop is required, otherwise you will get decompression sickness.

## Repetitive Diving

1. What is residual nitrogen? What is a repetitive dive?
   - nitrogen left in your body after a dive
2. How does residual nitrogen affect the no stop limits on a repetitive dive?
   - dive computer gives you shorter no stop times to account for the nitrogen still in your body.
3. What is a surface interval?
   - time you spend at the surface between two dives
4. What happens to the dissolved nitrogen in my body during a surface interval?
   - residual nitrogen in your body declines as it dissolves out of your tissues and leaves your body
5. How does my dive computer calculate repetitive dives?
   - it remembers nitrogen levels from previous dives and takes that into account
6. Why is it important that I dive with the same computer on every dive I make on a given day and not turn my computer off between dives?
   - Because your dive computer tracks your personal theoretical nitrogen levels continuously during all your dives and all your surface intervals, you must use the same computer the entire diving day, on all dives, and not share it with another diver.
7. How do dive tables address repetitive diving?
   - they use 3 tables

## Planning Dives with Your Computer

1. What are four advantages of dive computers over dive tables?
   - easier to use than tables
   - help offset human error
   - give you more time underwater
   - Besides the basic information you need while diving, most dive computers have other features.
2. What seven types of information do dive computers tell me before, during and/or between dives?
   - No stop (no decompression) limits
   - Depth
   - Elapsed time
   - No stop time remaining
   - Ascent rate warnings
   - Emergency decompression
   - Previous dive information
3. How do I set up and activate my dive computer? What is the first step?
   - first step is to read the fucking manual. Probably enter date and time and choose metric or imperial.
4. How do I plan dives with my dive computer?
   - Start by activating your computer and scrolling the no stop limits
   - Agree with your buddy(ies) on a maximum depth based on the no stop times displayed. Check the time for that depth

## Diving with Your Computer

1. What are six guidelines for diving with a computer?
   - Dive the plan
   - Stay well within your computer’s limits
   - Follow the most conservative computer – yours or a buddy’s
   - Watch your SPG
   - Start at your deepest point and go shallower
   - Ascend slowly
2. What should I do if my dive computer fails during a dive or between dives?
   - 2 options:
     - Signal your buddy(ies), ascend, make a safety stop and end the dive.
     - Continue the dive using a backup computer
