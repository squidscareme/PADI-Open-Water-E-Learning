# Being a Diver IV

## Your Health and Fitness

1. What general recommendations apply to my fitness as a diver?
   - Maintain a reasonable level of physical fitness
   - Keep your immunizations current, especially tetanus and typhoid.
   - Eat a well-balanced diet and get adequate rest, especially before diving.
   - It's a good idea to have a physical examination when you start diving, and regularly thereafter
2. How often is it recommended that I have a complete physical examination for diving?
   - once you start diving and regularly afterward
3. What factors in diving can strain my heart and cardiovascular system?
   - exertion from swimming hard
   - carrying equipment
   - climbing a ladder
   - long walks wearing gear
   - heat stress from wearing an exposure suit in a hot climate.
4. What should I do as a diver if I am or may be predisposed to heart disease?
   - talk to your doctor
5. What are the two most common substances that I should refrain from using before diving, and why?
   - Alcohol
     - affects your judgment
     - its effects may increase with depth
     - accelerates heat loss
     - dehydrates you so some think it may help lead to compression sickness
   - smoking tobacco
     - decreases the efficiency of your circulatory and respiratory systems
     - theoretically raises the risk of lung overexpansion injury by causing air trapping within your lungs
6. What are the recommendations for using prescribed or over-the-counter medications before diving?
   - use caution. if it affects your judgement then it shouldn't be used. talk to a doctor
7. What effect does menstruation have on diving?
   - if it doesn't affect most of your like then it shouldn't for diving
8. Why is it recommended that pregnant women not dive?
   - not enough data to determine if there is risk
9. What should I do if I feel ill before a dive?
    - cancel dive

## Staying Current and Active as a Diver

1. How do I keep my dive skills and knowledge current and refreshed?
   - dive regularly
2. How do I refresh my dive skills and knowledge after a period of inactivity? As a new PADI Open Water Diver after what interval of inactivity is this recommended?
   - PADI ReActivate program
3. How does continuing my diver training help keep my skills refreshed?
   - not only learn new skills and expand your capabilities, but use your existing skills as well

## The Air You Breathe

1. What component gases make up air?
   - nitrogen
   - oxygen
2. For practical purposes, what percent of each of the component gases does air consist of?
   - nitrogen - 79%
   - oxygen - 21%
3. To what four diving related issues does the makeup of air relate?
   - Oxygen toxicity
   - Contaminated air
   - Decompression sickness
   - Gas narcosis
4. How does using enriched air nitrox affect the component gases that make up air?
   - yo no se

## Oxygen Issues

1. How do I prevent problems with oxygen when diving with air?
   - don’t exceed the maximum depth for recreational diving
2. Why shouldn’t I dive with a cylinder labeled “oxygen” or known to be filled with 100 percent oxygen?
   - you can get oxygen sickness
   - it's combustible
3. Why is it important to be trained as a PADI Enriched Air Diver, or under the supervision of a PADI Enriched Air Instructor, before attempting to dive with enriched air?
   - you get get sick off your ass if you use pure oxygen at depth

## Contaminated Air

1. What are some possible causes of contaminated air?
   - Getting a cylinder filled at an improper source
   - Improper maintenance of the filling system
   - Very high levels of a contaminant in the source gas – more than the filters can keep out
2. What are five possible signs/symptoms of contaminated air?
   - smell/taste bad
   - Headache
   - Nausea
   - Dizziness
   - Unconsciousness/unresponsiveness
   - Cherry-red lips/fingernail beds
3. What should I do for a diver who I suspect breathed contaminated air?
   - have the person breathe fresh air
   - Give emergency oxygen if available
   - Provide CPR if required
   - Contact emergency medical care
4. How do I avoid contaminated air problems?
   - get your cylinder filled only at reputable scuba air sources

## Decompression Sickness

1. What two primary factors influence how much nitrogen dissolves into my body tissues during a dive?
   - depth (pressure)
   - time
2. What condition can result if I exceed established depth and time limits while diving, and then surface? What happens in the body that causes this condition?
   - decompression sickness
3. What are nine signs/symptoms of decompression sickness? How soon do they occur after a dive?
   - Paralysis
   - Dizziness
   - Tingling
   - Joint and limb pain
   - Shock
   - Numbness
   - Difficulty breathing
   - Weakness and prolonged fatigue
   - In severe cases, unconsciousness and death
4. Besides dive time and depth, what nine secondary factors are thought to influence how the body absorbs and releases dissolved nitrogen?
   - Fatigue
   - Dehydration
   - Cold
   - Poor fitness/high body fat
   - Illness
   - Injuries
   - Age
   - Alcohol consumption before or after a dive
   - Vigorous exercise before, during or immediately after the dive
