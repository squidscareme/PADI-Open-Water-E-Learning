## Your Role as a Diver

1. Are divers a significant threat to the overall health of the underwater environment?
   - no
2. Why is it important to apply environmentally friendly dive skills and awareness while underwater?

   - Dive skills and habits that are good for the environment are also good for you
3. What role do I have as a diver in the long-term survival and health of the world’s aquatic ecosystems?
   - Allows me to be part of the solution to the problems the world’s aquatic ecosystems face
