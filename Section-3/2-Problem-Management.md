# Problem Management

## Prevention

1. What approach to diving can help me prevent and manage problems?
   - To the best of your ability, always follow safe diving guidelines, have the recommended equipment and do as you’ve been trained, even when it doesn’t seem necessary.
2. How does continuing my diver education improve my ability to manage problems? Which four courses are recommended?
   - Continuing your diver education improves your ability to manage problems by learning, extending and refining emergency skills and giving you practice under guidance.
   - Four courses:
     - Advanced Open Water Diver course
     - Rescue Diver course
     - Emergency First Response Primary and Secondary Care courses
     - Emergency Oxygen Provider course

## Surface Problem Management – Responsive Diver

1. In what three ways can I prevent or control most dive problems that occur at the surface?
   - diving within your limits
   - relaxing while you dive
   - establishing and maintaining positive buoyancy on the surface
2. What should I do if a diving-related problem occurs at the surface?
   - immediately establish buoyancy by inflating your BCD or dropping your weights
3. How do the appearance and actions of a diver who needs help and is in control (not panicked) differ from a diver who needs help and is out of control (panicked)?
   - in control: moving with deliberate (purposeful) actions
   - panicked: struggle violently, expend a lot of energy
4. What are the four basic steps for assisting a responsive diver at the surface?
   - Establish buoyancy for yourself and the diver
   - Calm the diver by reassuring, offering encouragement and asking the person to relax
   - Help the diver reestablish breathing control
   - As necessary, assist the diver to the boat or shore

## Surface Problem Management – Unresponsive Diver

1. What are the primary concerns with an unresponsive diver?
   - check for breathing and to begin rescue breathing if the diver isn’t breathing
2. What does an unresponsive diver at the surface look like?
   - does not move
   - does not respond when tapped or spoken to
3. What are the four basic steps for assisting an unresponsive diver at the surface?
   - Establish buoyancy for the victim and for yourself. Inflate both BCDs and/or drop weights as necessary.
   - Call for help to the boat or shore.
   - Check for breathing. Begin providing rescue breaths if the victim isn’t breathing as you tow the diver to the boat or shore.
   - Continue rescue breathing (if needed) during the tow, and help get the victim out of the water.

## Underwater Problem Management

1. In what three ways can I prevent or control most dive problems that may occur underwater?
   - Relax while you dive.
   - Plan your air use with your buddy(ies) and watch it closely.
   - Dive within the limits of your experience and training.
2. How should I prevent and respond to overexertion underwater?
   - prevent: relax and don't overexert yourself
   - respond: stop all activity and catch your breath
3. How should I breathe from a free-flowing regulator?
   - do not seal your mouth on the mouthpiece to prevent lung overexpansion
   - sip off that bitch like a water fountain
4. What should I do if I become entangled underwater?
   - Stop, think and work slowly and calmly to free yourself
   - Get your buddy(ies) to help
   - Avoid twisting
   - Use cutting tool if needed
   - if severe, slip out of your scuba gear to free yourself, then put it back on
5. How should I prevent running low on or out of air underwater?
   - plan your shit out
6. In order of priority, what are my four options if I run out of air underwater?
   - Make a normal ascent.
   - Ascend using an alternate air source.
   - Make a Controlled Emergency Swimming Ascent (sometimes called CESA)
   - Make a buoyant emergency ascent.
7. How should I assist an unresponsive diver underwater? What is the priority?
   - Swim the diver to the surface. If necessary, use the diver’s BCD and/or drop weights to make the victim buoyant.
   - If the diver’s regulator is in the mouth, hold it there. If it is not, don’t waste time trying to replace it.
   - Ascend at a safe rate. If the diver’s buoyancy becomes too great for a safe ascent rate, let the victim go.
   - At the surface, follow the priorities and procedures for an unresponsive diver at the surface.

## First Responder Care for Diving-Related Emergencies

1. What signs and symptoms may be present with a diver who is or was unresponsive?
   - difficulty breathing
   - unconsciousness
   - unclear thinking
   - visual problems
   - paralysis
   - chest pain
   - lowered alertness
   - cardiac and respiratory arrest
2. What are my priorities when assisting someone who is or was unresponsive?
   - make sure the diver is breathing (by providing rescue breathing and/or CPR if necessary)
   - contact emergency medical care
3. What are the general steps to follow when giving aid to a diver who is or was unresponsive?
   - Keep the diver’s airway open and check for breathing.
   - Provide rescue breathing or CPR as necessary.
   - If the diver is unresponsive but breathing, keep the diver lying level on the left side
   - Check the diver’s breathing frequently
   - If the diver has regained responsiveness, keep the diver lying down comfortably.
   - Administer emergency oxygen as soon as possible.
   - Keep the diver still and maintain a normal body temperature by protecting from heat or cold.
   - Continue to provide care until emergency medical care arrives.
   - If you can’t accompany the diver to medical care, write down as much background information as possible about the individual and the dive, and attach it to the diver in a conspicuous place.
