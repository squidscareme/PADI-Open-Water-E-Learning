# Being a Diver I

## Water Pressure and Air Volume Effects

1. What is the relationship between my depth in water and the pressure?
    - deeper you go, higher the pressure
2. What is the pressure change for each 10 metres/33 feet of depth change?
    - 1 bar / 10 metres
3. What is the relationship between pressure, and the volume and density of air?
    - As pressure increases, air volume decreases and density decreases
4. If I take a volume of air from one depth to another depth, how much will the volume and density change?
    - Formula for air volume at depth relative to sea level pressure, where x is increase in depth by 10 meters: 
        F(x) => 1/(1 + x)
    - Formula for air density at depth relative to sea level pressure, where x is increase in depth by 10 meters:
        F(x) => x + 1

## The Effects of Increasing Pressure on Body Air Spaces

1. What three major body air spaces does increasing pressure affect as I descend?
   - ear, sinuses, mask
2. What is a “squeeze”?
   - The result of not adjusting to increasing pressure on body air space
3. What is “equalization” and how do I equalize as I descend?
   - Equalization is adding air to the body air spaces as you descend.
   - To equalize your ears and sinuses, pinch your nose and blow gently against it. Some people find that wiggling their jaws side to side and swallowing also works.
   - To equalize your mask, blow air into it through your nose as you descend.
4. How often should I equalize?
   - Equalize every metre/few feet, before you feel discomfort
5. What should I do if I can’t equalize? What can happen if I don’t or can’t equalize and keep descending?
   - stop your descent immediately
   - Signal your buddy or instructor. Signal “problem” and point to your ear
   - If you don't equalize, you can get ear injuries
6. Why should I equalize gently?
   - Forceful equalization can injure your ears and hearing
7. Why does congestion from a cold or allergy temporarily keep me from diving? Why should I never dive with earplugs?
8. What other body air spaces are affected by increasing pressure? How do I equalize them?
   - It's rare, but air trapped in tooth fillings can cause problems
   - A dry suit can cause equalization issues

## The Effects of Decreasing Pressure on Body Air Spaces

1. What is the most important rule in scuba diving?
   - breathe continuously and never, ever hold your breath.
   - This rule is so important, that any time your regulator is not in your mouth you exhale a slow, steady bubble stream so you aren’t holding your breath.
2. What can happen if I don’t follow the most important rule in scuba diving?
   - paralysis and death
3. What is a “reverse block”?
   - A reverse block (also called a reverse squeeze) results when expanding air becomes trapped in a body air space.
4. What should I do if I feel discomfort in my ears, sinuses, stomach, intestines or teeth while ascending?
   - stop, descend slightly and allow trapped air to work its way out.

## Breathing Underwater

1. How does depth affect how long my air supply lasts?
   - the deeper you are, the faster you use your air.
2. What’s the most efficient way to breathe dense air underwater?
   - take slow deep breaths
3. How do I breathe to reduce anxiety when under stress?
   - take slow deep breaths, you idiot
4. What are my four breathing rules as a scuba diver?
   - Breathe continuously and never, ever, hold your breath.
   - Breathe slowly and deeply.
   - Do not allow yourself to get winded or out of breath.
   - If faced with a problem, stop, then reduce anxiety by maintaining or restoring slow, deep breathing.

## Buoyancy and Controlling Buoyancy

1. What causes buoyancy?
   - it's caused by the water displaced by the object, and is equal to the weight of the water displaced.
2. What are positive buoyancy, negative buoyancy and neutral buoyancy?
   - Positive: object weighs less than the water it displaces, it floats.
   - Negative: object weighs more than the water it displaces, it sinks.
   - Neutral: object weighs the same as the water it displaces, it neither floats nor sinks
3. Why does salt water cause more buoyancy than fresh water?
   - salt water weighs more than fresh water due to dissolved minerals.
4. What two pieces of equipment do I normally use to control buoyancy?
   - weight system and BCD (Buoyancy Control Device)
5. How do descending and ascending affect my buoyancy?
   - some scuba equipment (particularly wetsuits) have gas spaces and these spaces compress at increasing depth
6. How does breathing affect my buoyancy?
   - lungs expand when breathing in, making positive buoyancy. Opposite for breathing out.
7. Why is it important to master buoyancy control?
   - Descend and ascend at a slow, controlled rate.
   - Stop a descent or ascent and maintain your depth with little effort.
   - Float comfortably on the surface.
   - Save energy and avoid harming sensitive aquatic organisms by swimming neutrally buoyant and controlling your movements.
   - Maintain the underwater visibility by helping you not stir up the bottom.
   - Enjoy one of the sensations unique to diving – “weightlessness.”
  
## The Buddy System

1. What is the buddy system?
   - diving with another diver or divers in a team that provides shared assistance and safety benefits.
2. What are three overall benefits of the buddy system?
   - Practicality – you assist each other before, during and after the dive.
   - Safety – you help each other prevent problems, and you assist each other if there is an emergency.
   - Fun – diving is a social activity; it’s rewarding and fun to have someone to share underwater adventures.
