## Choosing and Caring for Scuba Equipment

1. What are the three most important considerations in choosing scuba equipment?
   - **Suitability**:  means that the equipment is appropriate for you and the dive.
   - **Fit**:  means the equipment is sized and adjusted for you.
   - **Comfort**: means you can wear the item for an hour or more without a significant distraction due to its feel or configuration.
2. What are four secondary considerations when choosing scuba equipment?
   - **Cost and features** – You can choose gear from a price range, with more features on higher-end models.
   - **Serviceability** – Consider that some equipment requires annual or biannual professional servicing.
   - **Color and style** – You can choose gear that looks good and is color-coordinated.
   - **Accessories** – For each piece of equipment, your PADI Professional can suggest related accessories.
3. How do I generally care for scuba equipment?
   - Inspect your equipment for proper operation, wear and damage before each use.
   - Rinse everything thoroughly in clean, fresh water after use in salt water, chlorinated or fresh water with silt or dirt.
   - Avoid leaving your kit exposed to direct sunlight for extended periods, and cover it between dives.
   - Some items require periodic professional inspection, overhaul and/or adjustment. Have these items serviced regularly.
   - Follow any maintenance requirements specified by the manufacturer. See the manufacturer’s literature and/or website.

## Dive Masks

1. Why do I need a mask?
   - You need a mask to see clearly underwater. Your eyes must be in air to focus properly, but your mask creates an air space that you have to equalize.
2. Why does my mask need to enclose my nose?
   - Your mask creates an air space that you have to equalize. This is why your mask must enclose your nose – so you can blow air into it.
3. What features should I consider when choosing a mask? How do I check the fit?
   - To check for proper fit, you can place most masks gently against your face and inhale slightly through your nose. They should stay in place with light suction without pushing or twisting to make a seal.
4. How do I prepare a new mask for diving?
   - You may need to scrub the interior of the glass with a mask cleaner made for this purpose. This removes protective chemicals that some manufacturers apply. These chemicals increase a mask’s tendency to fog.
   - Your main preparation is to adjust the strap. Fit it over the crown of your head, above your ears, with a snug but not overly tight fit. Secure the strap-locking device if it has one. Many masks allow you to put them on slightly loose, then tighten for a perfect fit.

## Snorkels

1. Why do I need a snorkel?
   - Snorkels conserve your air supply when you need to breathe with your face in the water.
2. What features should I consider when choosing a snorkel?
   - **Flexible lower portion** – Allows the snorkel mouthpiece to drop out of the way when not in use.
   - **Self-drain valve** – Makes it easier to blow water out of the snorkel.
   - **Splash guard** – Reduces the amount of water than can splash in during use.
   - **Color** – You can match your other gear, though some divers like a bright color that’s easy to see.
3. How do I prepare my snorkel for diving?
   - Snorkel goes on the left side of your noggin. Adjust it so that with the mouthpiece in, the tip is over the crown of your head

## Fins

1. Why do I need fins?
   - Fins provide a large surface area for your powerful leg muscles to push against so you move efficiently through water.
2. What are the two basic fin styles?
   - adjustable strap
   - full-foot
3. What features should I consider when choosing fins?
   - fit
   - blade size
   - Optional features:
     - Material – Different materials affect performance, and make fins heavier or lighter.
     - Split fins – Some divers prefer the kicking characteristics of fins that have a split down the blade center.
     - Vents – Some fins let water pass through in key areas to assist performance.
     - Quick-release straps – Many adjustable fins have quick release buckles that make them easier to remove.
     - Spring straps – For adjustable fins, once you get the right size, spring straps “auto adjust” for a proper fit every time and are highly unlikely to wear out.
4. How do I prepare my fins for diving?
   - Adjust the strap on adjustable fins for a comfortable fit with your wet suit boots on.

## Scuba Kit

1. What four equipment systems combine to make my scuba kit (scuba unit), and what is the purpose of each?
   - BCD
   - Regulator
   - Cylinder
   - Weight system
2. What should I consider when choosing my scuba kit?
   - integrated packages versus piecing together individual components.
   - who will maintain the equipment. most shops service the brands they sell.

## BCD – Buoyancy Control Device

1. What five components make up a BCD, and what does each do?
   - **Inflatable bladder**: This is a very durable bag that you inflate or deflate to change your buoyancy.
   - **Cylinder band and harness/jacket**: The bladder integrates with an adjustable harness that holds the cylinder on your back.
   - **LPI (low pressure inflator) mechanism**: Usually at the end of a large-diameter hose, the LPI inflates the bladder with air from your cylinder, via the regulator, when you press a button. Another button allows you to deflate the bladder, or inflate it orally.
   - **Overpressure/quick exhaust valves**: To prevent rupturing the bladder due to overfilling, BCDs have one or more overpressure valves that automatically vent if the BCD is too full.
   - **Weight system** – Many BCDs have special weight pockets that you can release and drop in an emergency.
2. What considerations and options do I have when choosing a BCD?
   - Buoyancy capacity
   - Pockets and D-rings
   - Shoulder quick release
   - Colors and style
3. How do I prepare my BCD for use?
   - 1. put it on
   - 2. fully inflate it to be sure it doesn't restrict breathing
   - 3. Attach whistle near the low pressure inflator
4. What two special maintenance considerations do BCDs have?
   - rinse the inside of the bladder with fresh water as well as the outside.
   - store most BCDs partially inflated. This helps keep the bladder from sticking together inside.

## Regulators

1. What five components make up a regulator, and what does each do?
   - first stage
   - second stage
   - alternate air source
   - low-pressure inflator hose
   - SPG/computer
2. What is the most important consideration in choosing a regulator? What considerations and options do I have when choosing a regulator?
   - ease of breathing
3. What are my considerations and options when choosing an alternate air source?
   - simplicity versus independence
4. What are my considerations and options when choosing an SPG?
   - wireless or connected to the air supply
5. How do I prepare my regulator for use?
   - get a pro to attach all the parts for you
6. Where do I place or secure each regulator component when diving? Why is this important?
   - primary second stage goes over right shoulder
   - alternate air supply goes in the triangle, attached by quick release
   - spg with a hose usually routes under left arm. don't let it dangle.
7. What three special maintenance considerations do regulators have?
   - rinse it with fresh water with the first stage dust cap in place

## Cylinders

1. What two components make up a scuba cylinder? What does the burst disk do?
   - cylinder and valve
   - The burst disk is a safety device that relieves accidental overpressure by rupturing and releasing the air well before the cylinder would fail
2. What considerations and options do I have when choosing cylinders and valves?
   - material (steel or aluminum)
   - size/capacity
   - Yoke or DIN
   - Reserve or non-reserve valve
3. What do the markings on a cylinder tell me?
   - cylinder alloy
   - serial number
   - working pressure
   - manufacturer's identification
   - manufacture date
   - test pressure
   - hydrostatic test date
4. What three safety precautions for handling scuba cylinders should I follow?
   - Don’t leave a cylinder standing unattended
   - Secure cylinders for transportation
   - Keep cylinders secured on boats
5. What six special maintenance considerations do cylinders have?
   - Have your cylinder pressure tested at required intervals
   - Have it visually inspected annually. Scuba cylinders are drained, opened and inspected internally for corrosion or other contamination/damage
   - Close and open the valve gently
   - To prevent moisture from entering a cylinder, never completely empty it
   - Store the cylinder in a standing position in a safe place where it won’t get knocked over
   - Keep your cylinder out of high heat
6. Where do I get scuba cylinders filled? Why?
   - Get your cylinder filled only at a reputable scuba air station.Scuba air must be specially filtered, and filled by compressors designed specifically for breathing air.

## Weight Systems

1. What is the most important feature in my weight system?
   - quick release that enables you, in an emergency, to drop enough weight to float even with an un-inflated BCD
2. In an emergency, is it necessary to drop all my weight?
   - when wearing a wetsuit it should only be necessary to drop some of the weight to float, and in a just a plain bathing suit then you will need to drop all your weight
3. What is trim? Why is it important?
   - trim is the correct distribution of weight. desired trim is a natural horizontal swimming position with your feet parallel to the bottom or slightly elevated
4. Why might I use more than one weight system?
   - to help get good trim
5. What are my considerations and options when choosing one or more weight systems?
   - weight belt or bcd
