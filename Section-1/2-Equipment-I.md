## Choosing and Caring for Scuba Equipment

1. What are the three most important considerations in choosing scuba equipment?
   - **Suitability**:  means that the equipment is appropriate for you and the dive.
   - **Fit**:  means the equipment is sized and adjusted for you.
   - **Comfort**: means you can wear the item for an hour or more without a significant distraction due to its feel or configuration.
2. What are four secondary considerations when choosing scuba equipment?
   - **Cost and features** – You can choose gear from a price range, with more features on higher-end models.
   - **Serviceability** – Consider that some equipment requires annual or biannual professional servicing.
   - **Color and style** – You can choose gear that looks good and is color-coordinated.
   - **Accessories** – For each piece of equipment, your PADI Professional can suggest related accessories.
3. How do I generally care for scuba equipment?
   - Inspect your equipment for proper operation, wear and damage before each use.
   - Rinse everything thoroughly in clean, fresh water after use in salt water, chlorinated or fresh water with silt or dirt.
   - Avoid leaving your kit exposed to direct sunlight for extended periods, and cover it between dives.
   - Some items require periodic professional inspection, overhaul and/or adjustment. Have these items serviced regularly.
   - Follow any maintenance requirements specified by the manufacturer. See the manufacturer’s literature and/or website.

## Dive Masks

1. Why do I need a mask?
   - You need a mask to see clearly underwater. Your eyes must be in air to focus properly, but your mask creates an air space that you have to equalize.
2. Why does my mask need to enclose my nose?
   - Your mask creates an air space that you have to equalize. This is why your mask must enclose your nose – so you can blow air into it.
3. What features should I consider when choosing a mask? How do I check the fit?
   - To check for proper fit, you can place most masks gently against your face and inhale slightly through your nose. They should stay in place with light suction without pushing or twisting to make a seal.
4. How do I prepare a new mask for diving?
   - You may need to scrub the interior of the glass with a mask cleaner made for this purpose. This removes protective chemicals that some manufacturers apply. These chemicals increase a mask’s tendency to fog.
   - Your main preparation is to adjust the strap. Fit it over the crown of your head, above your ears, with a snug but not overly tight fit. Secure the strap-locking device if it has one. Many masks allow you to put them on slightly loose, then tighten for a perfect fit.
